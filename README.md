# Olist E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of the Olist E-Commerce Platform dataset published on Kaggle. Utilizing the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) methodology, I cleaned and transformed the data to derive insights that address key business questions. The project showcases my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and providing actionable recommendations using Power BI.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Importing
- Imported all relevant files into Power BI, ensuring to select the appropriate file types for successful data import.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Conducted data cleaning and transformation before loading the data, addressing issues such as inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values to ensure data quality.

### 3. Data Modelling
- Reviewed the automatic joins created by Power BI and established necessary relationships between tables that were not automatically identified.

### 4. Business Questions
- Identified at least five key business questions to guide the analysis, focusing on aspects such as customer behavior, sales trends, and operational efficiency.

### 5. Data Analysis and Visualization
- Analyzed the data to answer the identified business questions, utilizing Power BI's visualization capabilities to create interactive and informative reports.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations
- Documented insights and recommendations based on the analysis, providing actionable strategies for stakeholders to enhance business performance.

### 7. DAX Functions
- Employed DAX functions to create 1-2 calculated columns and several measures, enriching the analytical depth of the reports.

### 8. User Interaction
- Implemented navigation buttons, tooltips, and legends to improve user experience and facilitate easy navigation through the report.

### 9. Visualizations
- Utilized a variety of charts, maps (where applicable), filters, and slicers to create an interactive report that effectively communicates findings.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Power BI. The insights derived from the analysis can help stakeholders make informed decisions to improve business performance in the e-commerce sector.
